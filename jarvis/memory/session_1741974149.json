Therefore, it is not possible for me currently to provide the actual temperature and conditions in Oklahoma city.\n\nI suggest checking other reliable sources of this information like trusted online news websites or local government portals where you can find accurate forecasts about specific locations' weather condition(like OklaHim, Accuweather etc). They should give up-to date info on 'Oklahoma City'.  You could also use a mobile app for the best and most updated current information.\n",
